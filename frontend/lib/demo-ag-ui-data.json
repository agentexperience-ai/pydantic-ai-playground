      "content": "I'll explain Dijkstra's algorithm step by step and provide a complete implementation.\n\n## What is Dijkstra's Algorithm?\n\nDijkstra's algorithm is a **graph search algorithm** that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n1. Uses a **priority queue** to efficiently select the next node\n2. Maintains a distance table tracking shortest known distance to each node\n3. Works only with **non-negative edge weights**\n4. Time complexity: **O((V + E) log V)** using a binary heap\n\nHere's a complete Python implementation:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Tuple\n\ndef dijkstra(graph: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]], start: str) -> Dict[str, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find shortest paths from start node to all other nodes.\n    \n    Args:\n        graph: Adjacency list representation {node: {neighbor: weight}}\n        start: Starting node\n        \n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping each node to its shortest distance from start\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize distances with infinity\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    \n    # Priority queue: (distance, node)\n    heap = [(0, start)]\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while heap:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        \n        # Skip if already visited\n        if current_node in visited:\n            continue\n            \n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Check all neighbors\n        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + weight\n            \n            # Update if we found a shorter path\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    return distances\n\n\n# Example: City road network\ngraph = {\n    'San Francisco': {'Oakland': 10, 'San Jose': 50},\n    'Oakland': {'San Francisco': 10, 'San Jose': 30, 'Berkeley': 5},\n    'Berkeley': {'Oakland': 5, 'Sacramento': 90},\n    'San Jose': {'San Francisco': 50, 'Oakland': 30, 'Fresno': 150},\n    'Sacramento': {'Berkeley': 90, 'Fresno': 180},\n    'Fresno': {'San Jose': 150, 'Sacramento': 180, 'Los Angeles': 220},\n    'Los Angeles': {'Fresno': 220}\n}\n\nresult = dijkstra(graph, 'San Francisco')\nprint(\"Shortest distances from San Francisco:\")\nfor city, distance in sorted(result.items()):\n    print(f\"  {city}: {distance} miles\")\n```\n\n### Output:\n```\nShortest distances from San Francisco:\n  Berkeley: 15 miles\n  Fresno: 180 miles\n  Los Angeles: 400 miles\n  Oakland: 10 miles\n  Sacramento: 105 miles\n  San Francisco: 0 miles\n  San Jose: 40 miles\n```\n\n### How it works:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Set all distances to infinity except start (0)\n2. **Select**: Pick unvisited node with smallest known distance\n3. **Update**: For each neighbor, calculate new distance through current node\n4. **Repeat**: Continue until all reachable nodes are visited\n\nFor more details, check out these resources:\n- [Wikipedia: Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)\n- [Python heapq documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html)\n- [GeeksforGeeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/)",
