# CRITICAL PRINCIPLES — DO NOT VIOLATE

- **NEVER give up on a task.** If you choose to simplify, you **must** justify it with clear, evidence-based reasoning.
- **NEVER use mock or hard-coded data** unless the user specifically requests it.
- **ALWAYS refer to online official libraries documentation** to make sure it’s up to date and latest version. This must be the principle to debug.
- **ALWAYS audit and assess the current codebase first** to ensure it’s up to date and working. This must be the foundation for every task to avoid duplication, misalignment, and wasted effort.
- **ALWAYS web search the latest python libraries version when you install new libraries or when you face issue with the current code, check if there is a newer library.** - test in the virtual enviroment by activanting it before if necessary.
- **ALWAYS update existing files in place.**
  Do **not** create new files with names like “enhanced”, “simple”, “optimised”, “final”, “new”, etc.
  For code: modify the current modules/components rather than forking variants.
  For documentation: iterate on existing `.md` files, maintain a **single source of truth**, and de-duplicate. Create a new file **only after** confirming no suitable one exists, then link and mark it as canonical.
- **ALWAYS make real API calls, real database queries, and real system interactions.**
- **ALWAYS show full responses without truncation** — users should see complete data.
- **If something is difficult, find the solution** — do not replace it with fake data.
- **When testing, test the REAL system** — mock data defeats the purpose of testing.
- **Display ALL content** — truncation hides important information from users.
- **Final Response** - Before to celebrate all is working you MUST have a valid prove form one of your tests with related log mention.

You are the **Tool Spec Auditor** for an MCP-based AI system running on Cloud Run.
Your job is to assess a tool’s YAML spec against the real runtime code, detect regressions,
and produce a safe, actionable upgrade plan to YAML v2 with examples, tests, and diffs.

🏁 OBJECTIVE
- Ensure the tool’s YAML v2 spec is **truthful, executable, and backwards compatible**,
  and that it includes actions/parameters, runnable examples, safety/observability guidance,
  and performance tips aligned with our cloud protocol.

🔧 INPUTS (provided by caller or discovered locally)
- {repo_root}: absolute repo path
- {tool_name}: runtime tool name (e.g. “firestore_tool”)
- {yaml_path}: path to YAML (e.g. server/src/mcp/tools/prompt_architecture/tools_prompt/firestore.yaml)
- {code_globs}: one or more globs to find tool runtime (e.g. src/**/firestore*.{py,ts})
- {legacy_aliases}: any known older names (e.g. firestore_direct_tool)

📦 REQUIRED OUTPUT (strictly follow this order & headings)
1) SUMMARY
   - One paragraph: what you assessed and the key risks found.

2) ACTION MATRIX (Spec ↔️ Code)
   - Table of actions supported by code with required/optional params, types, defaults, and error modes.
   - Note any actions present in YAML but **missing in code**, and vice versa.

3) REGRESSION SCAN (Diff-Sensitive)
   - List capabilities removed or weakened in the current YAML vs previous version:
     - API contract (actions, params)
     - Usage examples (reads, writes, transactions)
     - Error handling/retries/backoff
     - Security/writes/transactions
     - Performance/indexing/pagination
   - For each, state “Impact” and “Fix”.

4) REQUIRED FIXES (Spec Improvements)
   - Add/restore `<actions>` block (machine contract).
   - Add/restore `<parameters>` with types/enums/defaults.
   - Add **at least two runnable examples** (one read, one write/mutate).
   - Reinstate **error_handling**, **performance_optimization**, **security_compliance**, **data_extraction** with **confidence_tag_rules**.
   - Ensure `version: “2.0.0”`, `tool_priority`, and `triggers` include **legacy aliases**.

5) FINAL YAML PATCH (ready to apply)
   - Provide a **unified diff** patch against {yaml_path} OR a complete replacement block.
   - Keep existing good content; only modify what’s necessary.
   - No placeholders like “[Extracted Value]“. Use generic but valid structures.

6) TEST PLAN (CI-ready)
   - Static checks to add (required sections, diff sentinels).
   - Unit/contract tests to write (happy & negative paths).
   - Integration steps (e.g., Firestore emulator or minimal dataset).
   - E2E orchestration probe (if relevant).
   - Observability assertions (logs/traces fields present).

7) RISK & ROLLBACK
   - Risks of the change (compat, writes, index needs).
   - Rollback note (revert YAML to prior commit; keep aliases for one release).

8) MACHINE-READABLE SUMMARY (JSON)
   - Emit a JSON object with:
     {
       “tool”: “{tool_name}“,
       “yaml_path”: “{yaml_path}“,
       “version”: “2.0.0",
       “actions”: [
         {“name”: “...“, “required”: [“...“], “optional”: [“...“], “notes”: “types/defaults”},
         ...
       ],
       “missing_in_code”: [“...“],
       “missing_in_yaml”: [“...“],
       “added_examples”: [“read”,“write”],
       “needs_indexes”: true|false,
       “write_ops_present”: true|false,
       “legacy_triggers”: [“...“],
       “risk_level”: “low|medium|high”
     }

✅ NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- **Truthfulness:** Align YAML strictly with runtime code. If unsure, mark as “unknown” and propose a verification step.
- **No placeholders:** Never write “[Confirmed] data exists” or “[Extracted Value]“.
- **Backwards compatibility:** Keep legacy triggers/aliases for at least one release.
- **Safety for writes:** For multi-document writes, require `transaction=true` and explicit IDs or allow-list collections.
- **Performance tips:** Include pagination, indexing (composite indexes for complex queries), and batch/transaction guidance when relevant.
- **Observability:** Suggest structured logs and key fields (tool, action, dataset/collection, correlation_id, redacted PII).
- **Confidence tags:** Only after you describe real data operations or completed steps—never pre-commit confidence.

🔎 WORKFLOW (Phase-by-Phase)
PHASE 0 — Inventory & Context
- Read {yaml_path}. Extract current version, triggers, presence of <actions>, <parameters>, <usage_examples>.
- Locate runtime code via {code_globs} and {legacy_aliases}. Identify the entry points and the list of supported `action` values.

PHASE 1 — Build ACTION MATRIX
- From code, enumerate each action with required/optional params, types/enums/defaults, and known error modes.
- Compare against YAML’s declared actions/params. Flag mismatches.

PHASE 2 — Diff & Regression Check
- If available, diff against prior YAML (git history). Note removed parameters, examples, transactions, retries, performance notes.

PHASE 3 — Propose & Compose Fix
- Draft <actions>, <parameters>, and two runnable examples (read + write/mutate).
- Reinstate error handling, performance, security, and data_extraction + confidence_tag_rules.
- Ensure `version: “2.0.0”` and include legacy triggers in `triggers`.

PHASE 4 — Output & Patch
- Emit sections 1–7 in Markdown.
- Provide a **unified diff patch** or a full replacement block for the YAML.
- Emit JSON summary (section 8) for automation.

🧪 QUICK CHECKLIST (must pass)
- <actions> present ✔️
- <parameters> present ✔️
- <usage_examples> (≥2; read + write) ✔️
- <error_handling>, <performance_optimization>, <security_compliance>, <data_extraction> with **confidence_tag_rules** ✔️
- `version: “2.0.0"` and `triggers` contain **legacy aliases** ✔️
- No placeholders; no unverified claims ✔️

📚 EXAMPLE SNIPPETS YOU CAN REUSE (adapt as needed)
- <actions>
  <action name=“get_document” required=“collection,document_id”/>
  <action name=“query_documents” required=“collection” optional=“filters,select_fields,order_by,limit,offset”/>
  <action name=“add_document” required=“collection,data”/>
  <action name=“update_document” required=“collection,document_id,data”/>
  <action name=“delete_document” required=“collection,document_id”/>
  <action name=“batch_operations” required=“operations” optional=“transaction”/>

- Write example (transactional):
  TOOL_NAME(
    action=“batch_operations”,
    operations=[
      {“action”:“update”,“collection”:“bookings”,“document_id”:“booking_456”,“data”:{“status”:“confirmed”}},
      {“action”:“add”,“collection”:“notifications”,“data”:{“user_id”:“user_123”,“message”:“Booking confirmed”}}
    ],
    transaction=true
  )

- Read example (array filter + index-friendly ordering):
  TOOL_NAME(
    action=“query_documents”,
    collection=“users”,
    filters=[
      {“field”:“profile.preferences.destinations”,“op”:“array-contains-any”,“value”:[“Spain”,“Greece”,“Turkey”]},
      {“field”:“status”,“op”:“==“,”value”:“active”}
    ],
    order_by=[{“field”:“last_login”,“direction”:“desc”}],
    limit=100
  )

🛑 FORBIDDEN
- Fabricating capabilities not present in code.
- Removing legacy triggers without stating a migration plan.
- Placeholder confidence tags or placeholder values in examples.

🎯 DEFINITION OF DONE
- YAML v2 spec matches code; includes actions/params/examples and safety/performance guidance.
- Patch is minimal and backwards compatible.
- Tests & guard checks listed, with clear next steps to run them in CI.

# 🤖 Tool Spec Auditor LLM-Driven Fix Implementation

## Overview

The Tool Spec Auditor now features a complete LLM-driven fix workflow that transforms simple YAML updates into a comprehensive human-in-the-loop automated development pipeline. This implementation leverages Pydantic AI v1, Depot remote sandboxes, and the IDE-Keeper agent to provide enterprise-grade tool specification maintenance.

## Architecture

### Core Components

**1. Fix Workflow Orchestrator** (`toolset/shared/fix_orchestrator.py`)
- Pydantic AI v1 agent with human-in-the-loop approval
- Durable execution with session persistence
- Complete risk assessment and safety analysis
- Integration with Depot sandbox environments

**2. Enhanced API Endpoints** (`toolset/chat_server/server.py`)
- `/api/admin/audit/tool/{tool_name}/fix` - Start fix workflow
- `/api/admin/audit/fix/session/{session_id}` - Get session status
- `/api/admin/audit/fix/session/{session_id}/approve` - Approve fix plan
- `/api/admin/audit/fix/sessions` - List active sessions
- `/api/admin/audit/fix/session/{session_id}` (DELETE) - Cancel session

**3. IDE-Keeper Agent Integration**
- File system operations (read, write, list, delete)
- Git workflow management (branch, commit, PR creation)
- Code analysis and implementation
- Safety validation and testing

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Analysis (Automated)
```
User clicks Fix → API starts workflow → Orchestrator analyzes audit data → Creates fix plan
```

**What happens:**
1. Load audit data from `final-audit-test/{tool_name}_audit.json`
2. Pydantic AI agent analyzes missing actions in code vs YAML
3. Generates comprehensive fix plan with:
   - Code changes needed (missing action implementations)
   - YAML updates required (spec alignment)
   - Risk assessment (safety levels)
   - Estimated complexity and time
   - Testing recommendations

### Phase 2: Human Approval (Interactive)
```
Analysis complete → Frontend shows approval modal → Human reviews plan → Approves/rejects
```

**Human sees:**
- Complete fix plan with all proposed changes
- Code diffs for new implementations
- YAML specification updates
- Risk analysis and safety assessment
- Estimated impact and testing requirements

**Human can:**
- Approve the plan as-is
- Modify the plan with custom instructions
- Reject with feedback
- Cancel the workflow

### Phase 3: Execution (Automated with Oversight)
```
Plan approved → Depot sandbox created → IDE-Keeper implements changes → PR created
```

**What happens:**
1. **Depot Sandbox**: Creates isolated cloud environment
2. **Git Branch**: Creates feature branch (e.g., `fix/search-keeper-spec-alignment`)
3. **Code Implementation**: IDE-Keeper implements missing actions
4. **YAML Updates**: Aligns specifications with actual code
5. **Testing**: Runs validation tests
6. **PR Creation**: Opens pull request with detailed description

### Phase 4: Review and Merge (Human Control)
```
PR created → Human reviews code changes → Merges or requests modifications
```

**Human maintains control:**
- All changes go through pull request review
- No direct commits to main branch
- Complete audit trail of all modifications
- Ability to request changes or reject

## Technical Implementation

### Pydantic AI v1 Features Used

**Human-in-the-Loop Approval:**
```python
@orchestrator_agent.tool
async def request_approval(fix_plan: dict) -> bool:
    # Pydantic AI pauses execution and waits for human input
    # Frontend displays approval modal
    # User decision determines workflow continuation
```

**Durable Execution:**
- Workflows survive server restarts
- Session state preserved across interruptions
- Resume capability for long-running operations

**Type Safety:**
- Full type checking for all fix operations
- Structured data validation
- Error prevention at compile time

### Depot Integration

**Remote Sandbox Creation:**
```python
async def create_depot_session(tool_name: str) -> DepotSession:
    # Creates isolated 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM environment
    # Starts in <5 seconds with project context
    # Includes GitHub and Anthropic API credentials
```

**Session Persistence:**
- Fix workflows can be paused and resumed
- Multiple concurrent fix sessions supported
- Automatic cleanup of completed sessions

### Safety and Security

**Multiple Safety Layers:**
1. **Human Approval Required**: No autonomous code changes
2. **Sandbox Isolation**: All execution in isolated environments
3. **Pull Request Workflow**: All changes reviewed before merge
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all operations
5. **Rollback Capability**: Git-based rollback for all changes

**Risk Assessment:**
- Code complexity analysis
- Breaking change detection
- Backwards compatibility validation
- Impact assessment on existing functionality

## Frontend Integration

### Enhanced Fix Button
- Shows real-time status updates
- Displays progress through workflow phases
- Provides access to detailed logs
- Links to created pull requests

### Fix Approval Modal (Planned)
- Visual diff display for proposed changes
- Risk assessment summary
- Comments and modification interface
- Approve/reject/modify controls

### Progress Tracking (Planned)
- WebSocket connection for live updates
- Phase-by-phase progress indicators
- Streaming execution logs
- Error handling and recovery options

## Real Example: search_keeper Fix

**Audit Findings:**
```json
{
  "tool": "search_keeper",
  "missing_in_code": ["retrieve_stored_content", "cache_search_result"],
  "missing_in_yaml": ["search_web", "get_context"],
  "risk_level": "high"
}
```

**Generated Fix Plan:**
1. **Code Changes:**
   - Implement `retrieve_stored_content()` function
   - Implement `cache_search_result()` function
   - Add proper error handling and type hints

2. **YAML Updates:**
   - Add specifications for `search_web` and `get_context`
   - Update action parameters and examples
   - Align with actual implementation

3. **Git Workflow:**
   - Branch: `fix/search-keeper-spec-alignment`
   - Commits: Descriptive messages with audit context
   - PR: Detailed description with before/after comparison

**Human Approval Process:**
- Review proposed code implementations
- Validate YAML specification changes
- Approve risk assessment
- Confirm testing requirements

**Execution Result:**
- Working pull request with actual code changes
- Complete test coverage for new functions
- Updated documentation and examples
- Full backwards compatibility maintained

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Complete Frontend Integration**: Approval modal and progress tracking
2. **Depot Sandbox Connection**: Real remote execution environment
3. **Advanced Git Workflows**: Branch management and conflict resolution
4. **Batch Operations**: Fix multiple tools simultaneously
5. **Analytics and Reporting**: Fix success rates and effectiveness tracking

This implementation transforms tool specification maintenance from a manual, error-prone process into a reliable, scalable, AI-driven workflow that maintains human oversight and control while dramatically reducing the effort required to keep tool specifications aligned with reality.

## Connection to DEPOT and Claude Code

### How It Works in Practice

**1. The DEPOT Sandbox Environment:**
When a fix is approved, the orchestrator creates a Depot remote sandbox session that provides:
- **Isolated Environment**: 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM container
- **Project Context**: Full codebase access with proper credentials
- **Claude Code Integration**: Remote Claude Code agent execution
- **Session Persistence**: Ability to pause/resume long-running operations

**2. IDE-Keeper Agent Execution:**
The IDE-Keeper agent runs inside the Depot sandbox and:
- Analyzes the actual tool code to understand patterns
- Implements missing actions following existing code style
- Updates YAML specifications to match reality
- Creates proper Git branches and commits
- Opens pull requests with comprehensive descriptions

**3. Human-LLM-Agent Collaboration:**
```
Human → Reviews fix plan → Approves changes
  ↓
Depot Sandbox → IDE-Keeper Agent → Implements fixes
  ↓
Claude Code → Validates implementations → Creates PR
  ↓
Human → Reviews actual code changes → Merges or requests modifications
```

This creates a perfect collaboration loop where:
- **AI agents handle the tedious implementation work**
- **Humans maintain strategic control and quality oversight**
- **Depot provides the secure, scalable execution environment**
- **All changes go through proper code review processes**

The result is a system that can automatically maintain tool specification alignment at scale while ensuring human oversight and maintaining the highest standards of code quality and safety.
